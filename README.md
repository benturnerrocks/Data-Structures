# Data-Structures
My coursework learning about common data structures in CS201 (Data Structures) at Carleton College. These mini-projects include:
- *Homework-1-Guessing-Game...* is a game that generates a number between 1 and 100 at random and asks the user to guess
- *Homework-3-Country-displayer...* and *Homework-5-Country-displayer-redux* display a bar graph of countries ordered by a given indicator. The redux version is a cleaned-up and enhanced version.
- *Homework-6-Mazes...* creates a maze and then solves it using a stack
- *HW-7-Wikipaths...* creates a graph of the links between Wikipedia articles and then finds the shortest path between two articles
- *Homework-8-Sorting-investigations...* explores popular sorting methods including pivot sorts, radix sort, and quicksort.
- *Homework-9-Word-clouds...* creates and displays a word map created from a book (excluding stop words) using a tree
- *HW10-Flashcard-Displayer...* creates a flashcard displayer based on a priority queue
- *HW11-Hash-Table...* is an in-class lab for learning about hash code functions and collisions

This course taught me fundamental data structures, object-oriented programming, and just plainly how to think and code like a computer scientist. I am forever grateful to Anna Rafferty and her guidance in this course.
